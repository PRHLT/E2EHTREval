Even worse is to langh. Tremendons damage may be done to a child by langhing at what are very real fears. Ar adults, we know that their feass are groundles, indeed to us they appear laghabl, but to a child theey are very real. Not that I am sugerting that children should be moll-coddled - they must be made to face their fiars, to see through them and come out on the ther side as victors.
