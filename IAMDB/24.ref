The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue, which is written on two plates, the hard facts of life, and all facts are " one ". We have all come across human Shamirs and they leave a deep impression on our feelings and senses. They make us the Altar for God to emit the Light which can be read in every language. The Shamir is the " seventh " and most important creature, that was created on the eve of the Sabbath, to bring the Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
