An hour's riding brought us to a trail that we figured would lead to the miners' camp. We turned north into it and after about four miles it led into a small canyon which opened out into a wide shallow draw. Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found the miners at work. They were scattered over a fairly wide area working singly or in pairs.
