Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor freedom from fear, fear of starvation in the midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forth- coming for the people in need. They will think of the animals first ( which is of course our duty ). Of course the individual will eat and be full but : " Take heed to yourself, that your heart be not deceived, and 1ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them ", the yourself is thy greatest enemy, the self- seeking self.
