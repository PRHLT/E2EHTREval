One can remember with horror the pictures of the overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantel- piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years after the Victorian period that designers realised the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was revived with designs suitable for contemporary trends. Crochet today has a variety of uses, and has even stepped into the field of high fashion.
