Then they stop swimming and are caught. In the seine-net film this usually seemed to happen just after the fish had risen above the footrope, and presumably out of its field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests that the wave might be transmitted by the sea-bed, though the footrope in this case was actually just off the bottom and was indeed passing over some fish.
