Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much co-operation especially with the other Christian communities. At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the ' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation ' allowances, but soon, alas !, as casualties began and increased in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
