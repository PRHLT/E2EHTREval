There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.
