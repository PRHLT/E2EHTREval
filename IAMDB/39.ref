The new century opened with James 1 ascending the throne. He was quite prepared to be tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland, but those hopes were dashed. True, a new Prayer Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans derived little comfort from it.
