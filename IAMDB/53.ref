Even more simply, test your own reactions to different situations. There are some which bring on an almost immediate feeling of tiredness - such as when your wife mentions the washing-up - while others, if they refer to something you like doing, bring a veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump up with no apparent tiredness at all when her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.
