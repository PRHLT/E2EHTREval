This last objection might have had some weight in ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13. 11-12, the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making. As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his information is contemporaneous with the New Testament. The other form of book was the codex. In this the sheets were bound together down one edge much as they are in modern books.
