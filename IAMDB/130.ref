Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast, placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe which he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a brown sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a gin punch.
