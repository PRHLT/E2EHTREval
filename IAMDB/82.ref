Herring fishermen call this " the outset ". It is strongest at spring tides, when without wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east- ward, the length of half a fleet of nets - almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's Knoll. Without an explanation of how it works, it may well be that this outset, akin to the mouth of a great salmon river, has been the biggest factor through the ages in the constancy of this great herring fishery.
