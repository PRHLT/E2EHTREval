Motion there was, but motion without event - except for those negligible events that seemed so large to the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor and Haris there were many events.

To sail up in the light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World had no place here.
