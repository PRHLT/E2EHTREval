As they became known the Choir went to working- men's clubs, to Conisborough on cheap trips to sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such as the Bakers' Union, for whom they went on Satur- day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally the members. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms on West Street, where a successful Sunday school was held.
