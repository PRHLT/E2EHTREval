The Gemara continues with a saying of the Palestinian teacher, R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) : ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places : the court of Shem, the court of Samuel of Ramah, and the court of Solomon. ' The place of this saying here is obvious, it follows naturally on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which deals with a similar theme.
