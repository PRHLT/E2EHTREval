The porter at the station bore out this description, but the man was not traced. Perhaps the news of their search got around, for a man did obligingly present himself at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have committed the murder - but he was mentally defective, and, despite his claim to infamy, had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.
