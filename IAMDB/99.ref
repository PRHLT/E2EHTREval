So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head remained a mystery until later the following day. During that time a description of the girl was circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two. The girl, who was described as being " always bright and jolly, " had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill, Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for whom she worked as a book-keeper.
