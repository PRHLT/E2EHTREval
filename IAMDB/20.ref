The word Shamir was used as a personal name ( Git. 68a ). The Hebrew word " SHAMIR " means guarded or preser- ved. Therefore, the real man, who regards himself as insignificant, as the prayer says : " What am I ? A worm ", he is the Shamir and such a man fulfils the Shmah, loves the Lord God with all his heart, and with all his soul and with all his might and studies the word of God.
