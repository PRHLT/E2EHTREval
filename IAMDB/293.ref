Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side of the church where there was a small open outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades and forks and tidying up implements. It might be open. It was.

When a man was drowning and towards his last gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole life came up before him in some cinematic kind of sequence.
