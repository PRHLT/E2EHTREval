Easterly winds, on the other hand, mean no herring along the shore, as recent years have shown. A succession of winds is needed for this effect of course - one breeze will not do it, though a very hard westerly will often start off the " local " herring ; but quite apart from this wind effect there is an easterly drift special to this rump of coastline, caused by the meeting of water from north and south.
