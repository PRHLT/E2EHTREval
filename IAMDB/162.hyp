But what a change firom the deaur little old church at Tatsfieled to the great modern church of St. Mari's at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries had been a House of Prayer. I could not but Feel the chilliness of the new church, beautitul as it was and is when we had found a group of people who glandly co-operated, we made the lit chaple sidel a place of daily prayer.
