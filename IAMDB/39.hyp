The new century opened with James 1 ascending the throne. He was quite prepared to be tolerant towards Rome though the fiumpower Plot spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland, but those hopes were dasted. Trne, a new Prayer Bork was issued in 1860y but the Puritans deriveed little comfort from it.
