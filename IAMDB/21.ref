This man is the worm, the creature that cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such a man is the Shamir that guards him- self against all the irrelevant pleasures. Such a Shamir possesses the real acid to mould our character, to melt our heart of stone. This Shamir helps us earthly creatures to build an Altar for God to come nearer to God.
