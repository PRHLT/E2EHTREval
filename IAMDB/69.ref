( This is probably to be understood as a well- known comment on the verse ; quoted by Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b. Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah. There is no reference to the Mishnah here because the Mishnah deals with the actual practice of greeting by the divine Name and the Gemara here quotes the texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.
